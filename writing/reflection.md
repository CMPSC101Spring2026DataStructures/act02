## Q1: Benefits of Package Managers

Based on your experience with this activity, explain why package managers like UV are important for software development. Compare this to manually downloading and installing Python libraries one by one.

TODO

## Q2: Virtual Environments

UV automatically creates isolated virtual environments for each project. Why is this isolation important? Give an example of a problem that could occur if all your Python projects shared the same packages and versions.
